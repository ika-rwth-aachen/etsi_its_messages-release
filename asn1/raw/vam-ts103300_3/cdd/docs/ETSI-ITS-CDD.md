    decelerate (1) 
}
```


### <a name="AccelerationConfidence"></a>AccelerationConfidence
This DE indicates the acceleration confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an acceleration value with a default confidence level of 95 %. 
 If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.

 The value shall be set to:
 - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 101`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
 - `101` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 10 m/s<sup>2</sup>,
 - `102` if the confidence value is unavailable.

 The value 0 shall not be used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Unit:** _0,1 m/s<sup>2</sup>_

 acceleration control system is engaged or not. Currently, this DE includes the information of the
 vehicle brake pedal, gas pedal, emergency brake system, collision warning system, adaptive cruise
 control system, cruise control system and speed limiter system.

 The corresponding bit shall be set to 1 under the following conditions:
 - 0 - `brakePedalEngaged`      - Driver is stepping on the brake pedal,
 - 1 - `gasPedalEngaged`        - Driver is stepping on the gas pedal,
 - 2 - `emergencyBrakeEngaged`  - emergency brake system is engaged,
 - 3 - `collisionWarningEngaged`- collision warning system is engaged,
 - 4 - `accEngaged`             - ACC is engaged,
 - 5 - `cruiseControlEngaged`   - cruise control is engaged,
 - 6 - `speedLimiterEngaged`    - speed limiter is engaged.

 Otherwise (for example when the corresponding system is not available due to non equipped system
 or information is unavailable), the corresponding bit shall be set to 0.

### <a name="LanePosition"></a>LanePosition
This DE indicates a transversal position on the carriageway at a specific longitudinal position, in resolution of lanes of the carriageway. 

 For right-hand traffic roads, the value shall be set to:
 - `-1` if the position is off, i.e. besides the road,
 - `0` if the position is on the inner hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to the leftmost lane,
 - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 14`), if the position is on the n-th driving lane counted from the leftmost lane to the rightmost lane of a specific traffic direction,
 - `14` if the position is on the outer hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to rightmost lane (if present).

 For left-hand traffic roads, the value shall be set to:
 - `-1` if the position is off, i.e. besides the road,
 - `0` if the position is on the inner hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to the rightmost lane,
 - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 14`), if the position is on the n-th driving lane counted from the rightmost lane to the leftmost lane of a specific traffic direction,
 - `14` if the position is on the outer hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to leftmost lane (if present).


 If the carriageway allows only traffic in one direction (e.g. in case of dual or multiple carriageway roads), the position is counted from the physical border of the carriageway. 
 If the carriageway allows traffic in both directions and there is no physical delimitation between traffic directions (e.g. on a single carrriageway road), 
 the position is counted from the legal (i.e. optical) separation between traffic directions (horizontal marking).

>>>
NOTE:&emsp;The fact that a position coordinate value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(4095)`.
 can be caused by several reasons, such as:
 - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 In all 3 cases above, the position coordinate value may be valid and used by the application.
 If a position coordinate value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(4094)`, it means that
 the position coordinate value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful
 for the application.

### <a name="SteeringWheelAngleConfidence"></a>SteeringWheelAngleConfidence
This DE indicates the steering wheel angle confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy for a  steering wheel angle value with a confidence level of 95 %.
 
 The value shall be set to:
 - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 126`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 1,5 degrees,
 - `126` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 187,5 degrees,
 - `127` if the confidence value is not available.

 
 If a steering wheel angle value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(126)`,
 it means that the steering wheel angle value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted.
 Such value is not useful for the application.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Unit:** _1,5 degree_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Categories:** Vehicle Information 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Revision:** _Description revised in V2.1.1_

>>>
NOTE:&emsp;The fact that a steering wheel angle value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(127)`
 can be caused by several reasons, such as:
 - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 In all 3 cases above, the steering wheel angle value may be valid and used by the application.

NOTE:&emsp;International Atomic Time (TAI) is the time reference coordinate on the basis of the readings of atomic clocks, 
 operated in accordance with the definition of the second, the unit of time of the International System of Units. 
 TAI is a continuous time scale. UTC has discontinuities, as it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds. 
 As of 1 January, 2022, TimestampIts is 5 seconds ahead of UTC, because since the ITS epoch on 1 January 2004 00:00:00.000 UTC, 
 further 5 leap seconds have been inserted in UTC.

### <a name="YawRateConfidence"></a>YawRateConfidence
This DE indicates the yaw rate confidence value which represents the estimated accuracy for a yaw rate value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
 If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
 
 The value shall be set to:
 - `0` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,01 degree/second,
 - `1` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,05 degrees/second or greater than 0,01 degree/second,
 - `2` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,1 degree/second or greater than 0,05 degree/second,
 - `3` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 1 degree/second or greater than 0,1 degree/second,
 - `4` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 5 degrees/second or greater than 1 degrees/second,
 - `5` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 10 degrees/second or greater than 5 degrees/second,
 - `6` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 100 degrees/second or greater than 10 degrees/second,
 - `7` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 100 degrees/second,
 - `8` if the confidence value is unavailable.
 
 NOTE: The fact that a yaw rate value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(8)` can be caused by
 several reasons, such as:
 - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 In all 3 cases above, the yaw rate value may be valid and used by the application.
 
 If a yaw rate value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(7)`, it means that the 
 yaw rate value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful the application.
