# * This DE represents the possible VRU environment conditions.
# *
# * - The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 `unavailable`            - to indicate that the information on the type of environment is unavailable,
# * - 1 `intersectionCrossing`   - to indicate that the VRU is on an intersection or crossing,
# * - 2 `zebraCrossing`          - to indicate that the VRU is on a  zebra crossing (crosswalk),
# * - 3 `sidewalk`               - to indicate that the VRU is on a sidewalk,
# * - 4 `onVehicleRoad`          - to indicate that the VRU is on a traffic lane,
# * - 5 `protectedGeographicArea`- to indicate that the VRU is in a protected area.
# * - value 6 to 15              - are reserved for future usage.
