# *
# * This DF represents activation data for real-time systems designed for operations control, traffic light priorities, track switches, barriers, etc.
# * using a range of activation devices equipped in public transport vehicles.
# *
# * The activation of the corresponding equipment is triggered by the approach or passage of a public transport
# * vehicle at a certain point (e.g. a beacon).
# *
# * @field ptActivationType: type of activation. 
# *
# * @field ptActicationData: data of activation. 
# *
# * Today there are different payload variants defined for public transport activation-data. The R09.x is one of
# * the industry standard used by public transport vehicles (e.g. buses, trams) in Europe (e.g. Germany Austria)
# * for controlling traffic lights, barriers, bollards, etc. This DF shall include information like route, course,
# * destination, priority, etc.
# * 
# * The R09.x content is defined in VDV recommendation 420 [7]. It includes following information:
# * - Priority Request Information (pre-request, request, ready to start)
# * - End of Prioritization procedure
# * - Priority request direction
# * - Public Transport line number
# * - Priority of public transport
# * - Route line identifier of the public transport
# * - Route number identification
# * - Destination of public transport vehicle
# *
# * Other countries may use different message sets defined by the local administration.
# * @category: Vehicle information
# * @revision: V1.3.1
