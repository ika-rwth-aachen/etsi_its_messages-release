# * This DF represents the value of a cartesian coordinate with a range of -327,68 metres to +327,66 metres.

# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `-32 768` if the longitudinal offset is out of range, i.e. less than or equal to -327,68 metres,
# * - `n` (`n > -32 768` and `n < 32 767`) if the longitudinal offset information is equal to or less than n x 0,01 metre and more than (n-1) x 0,01 metre,
# * - `32 767` if the longitudinal offset is out of range, i.e. greater than + 327,66 metres.
