# * 
# * This DF provides information about a VRU cluster.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field clusterId: optional identifier of a VRU cluster.
# *
# * @field clusterBoundingBoxShape: optionally indicates the shape of the cluster bounding box, per default inside an East-North-Up coordinate system 
# * centered around a reference point defined outside of the context of this DF.
# *
# * @field clusterCardinalitySize: indicates an estimation of the number of VRUs in the group, e.g. the known members in the cluster + 1 (for the cluster leader) .
# *
# * @field clusterProfiles: optionally identifies all the VRU profile types that are estimated to be within the cluster.
# * if this component is absent it means that the information is unavailable. 
# *
# * @category: VRU information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1, description revised in V2.2.1
