# * This DF represents a predicted path, predicted trajectory or predicted path zone together with usage information and a prediction confidence.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field pathPredicted: the predicted path (pathDeltaTime ABSENT) or trajectory (pathDeltaTime PRESENT) and/or the path zone (symmetricAreaOffset PRESENT).
# *
# * @field usageIndication: an indication of how the predicted path will be used. 
# *
# * @field confidenceLevel: the confidence that the path/trajectory in pathPredicted will occur as predicted.
# *
# * @category: GeoReference information
# * @revision: created in V2.2.1
