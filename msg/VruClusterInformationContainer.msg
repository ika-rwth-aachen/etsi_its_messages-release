# * @details VruClusterInformationContainer
# * The VRU Cluster Information container of the VAM provides the information/parameters relevant to the VRU cluster.
# * It is mandatory if the VAM is transmitted by VRU cluster leader.
# * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.5 of TS 103 300-3): 
# *
# * @field vruClusterInformation: set of parammeters releated to the VRU cluster. 
# *        When transmitted by a VRU ITS-S, the clusterId and clusterBoundingBoxShape fields inside this DF shall be present.
# *        The clusterBoundingBoxShape is positioned with respect to the position sent in the BasicContainer.
