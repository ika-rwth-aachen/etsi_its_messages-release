# * This DE represents the height of the left or right longitude carrier of vehicle from base to top (left or right carrier seen from vehicle
# * rear to front). 
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `n` (`n >= 1` and `n < 99`) if the height information is equal to or less than n x 0,01 metre and more than (n-1) x 0,01 metre,
# * - `99` if the height is out of range, i.e. equal to or greater than 0,98 m,
# * - `100` if the height information is not available.
# *
# * @unit 0,01 metre
# * @category Vehicle information
# * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1 (the definition of 99 has changed slightly)
