# * This DF indicates a position on a topology description transmitted in a MAPEM according to ETSI TS 103 301 [15].
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# * 
# * @field mapReference: optionally identifies the MAPEM containing the topology information.
# * It is absent if the MAPEM topology is known from the context.
# * 
# * @field laneId: optionally identifies the lane in the road segment or intersection topology on which the position is located.
# *
# * @field connectionId: optionally identifies the connection inside the conflict area of an intersection, i.e. it identifies a trajectory for travelling through the
# * conflict area of an intersection which connects e.g an ingress with an egress lane.
# *
# * @field longitudinalLanePosition: optionally indicates the longitudinal offset of the map-matched position of the object along the lane or connection measured from the start of the lane/connection, along the lane.
# * 
# * @category: Road topology information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1, definition of longitudinalLanePosition amended in V2.2.1
