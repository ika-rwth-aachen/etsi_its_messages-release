# PathPredicted::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..16,...)) OF PathPointPredicted
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *
# * This DF represents a predicted path or trajectory with a set of predicted points and optional information to generate a shape which is estimated to contain the real path. 
# * It shall contain up to `16` @ref PathPointPredicted. 
# * 
# * The first PathPoint presents an offset delta position with regards to an external reference position.
# * Each other PathPoint presents an offset delta position and optionally an offset travel time with regards to the previous PathPoint. 
# *
# * @category: GeoReference information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1 , size constraint changed to SIZE(1..16, ...) in V2.2.1
