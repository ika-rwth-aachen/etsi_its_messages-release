# * This DF indicates a transversal position in relation to the different lanes of the road. 
# * It is an extension of DE_LanePosition to cover locations (sidewalks, bicycle paths), where Vehicle ITS-S would normally not be present. 
# *
# * The following options are available:
# *
# * @field trafficLanePosition: a position on a traffic lane. 
# * 
# * @field nonTrafficLanePosition: a position on a lane which is not a traffic lane.
# * 
# * @field trafficIslandPosition: a position on a traffic island
# * 
# * @field mapPosition: a position on a lane identified in a MAPEM.
# *  
# * @category: Road Topology information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1
