# * This DF is a representation of the cause code value of a traffic event. 
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field causeCode: the main cause of a detected event. 
# *
# * @field subCauseCode: the subordinate cause of a detected event. 
# *
# * The semantics of the entire DF are completely defined by the component causeCode. The interpretation of the subCauseCode may 
# * provide additional information that is not strictly necessary to understand the causeCode itself, and is therefore optional.
# *
# * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use the @ref CauseCodeV2 instead. 
# *
# * @category: Traffic information
# * @revision: Editorial update in V2.1.1
