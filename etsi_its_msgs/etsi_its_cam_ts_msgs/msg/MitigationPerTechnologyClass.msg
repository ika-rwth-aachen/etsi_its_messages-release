# * This DF represents a set of mitigation parameters for a specific technology, as specified in ETSI TS 103 724 [24], clause 7.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field accessTechnologyClass:  channel access technology to which this mitigation is intended to be applied.
# *
# * @field lowDutyCycle: duty cycle limit.
# * @unit: 0,01 % steps
# *
# * @field powerReduction: the delta value of power to be reduced.
# * @unit: dB
# *
# * @field dmcToffLimit: idle time limit as defined in ETSI TS 103 175 [19].
# * @unit: ms
# *
# * @field dmcTonLimit: Transmission duration limit, as defined in ETSI EN 302 571 [20].
# * @unit: ms
# *
# * @note: All parameters are optional, as they may not apply to some of the technologies or
# * interference management zone types. Specification details are in ETSI TS 103 724 [24], clause 7.
