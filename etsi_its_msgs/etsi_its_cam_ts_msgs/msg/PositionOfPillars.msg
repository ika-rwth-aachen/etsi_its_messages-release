# *
# * This DF shall contain a list of distances @ref PosPillar that refer to the perpendicular distance between centre of vehicle front bumper
# * and vehicle pillar A, between neighbour pillars until the last pillar of the vehicle.
# *
# * Vehicle pillars refer to the vertical or near vertical support of vehicle,
# * designated respectively as the A, B, C or D and other pillars moving in side profile view from the front to rear.
