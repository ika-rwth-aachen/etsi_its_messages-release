#* This DE represent the total amount of rain falling during one hour. It is measured in mm per hour at an area of 1 square metre.  
#* 
#* The following values are specified:
#* - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 2000`) if the amount of rain falling is equal to or less than n x 0,1 mm/h and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 mm/h,
#* - `2000` if the amount of rain falling is greater than 199.9 mm/h, 
#* - `2001` if the information is not available.
#*
#* @unit: 0,1 mm/h
