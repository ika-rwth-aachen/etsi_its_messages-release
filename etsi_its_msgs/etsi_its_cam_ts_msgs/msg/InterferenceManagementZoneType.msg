# * This DE defines the type of an interference management zone, so that an ITS-S can 
# * assert the actions to do while passing by such zone (e.g. reduce the transmit power in case of a DSRC tolling station).
# * It is an extension of the type @ref ProtectedZoneType.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 - `permanentCenDsrcTolling` - as specified in ETSI TS 102 792 [14],
# * - 1 - `temporaryCenDsrcTolling` - as specified in ETSI TS 102 792 [14],
# * - 2 - `unavailable`             - default value. Set to 2 for backwards compatibility with DSRC tolling,
# * - 3 - `urbanRail`               - as specified in ETSI TS 103 724 [13], clause 7,
# * - 4 - `satelliteStation`        - as specified in ETSI TS 103 724 [13], clause 7,
# * - 5 - `fixedLinks`              - as specified in ETSI TS 103 724 [13], clause 7.
