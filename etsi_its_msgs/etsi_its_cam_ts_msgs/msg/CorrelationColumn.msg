# CorrelationColumn ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..13,...) OF CorrelationCellValue  
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *
# * This DF represents a column of a lower triangular positive semi-definite matrix and consists of a list of correlation cell values ordered by rows.
# * Given a matrix "A" of size n x n, the number of columns to be included in the lower triangular matrix is k=n-1.
# * Each column "i" of the lower triangular matrix then contains k-(i-1) values (ordered by rows from 1 to n-1), where "i" refers to the column number count
# * starting at 1 from the left.
