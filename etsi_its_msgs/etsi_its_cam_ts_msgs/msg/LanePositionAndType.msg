# * It shall include the following components: 
# * 
# * @field transversalPosition: the transversal position.
# * 
# * @field laneType: the type of the lane identified in the component transversalPosition. By default set to `traffic`.
# *
# * @field direction: the traffic direction for the lane position relative to a defined reference direction. By default set to `sameDirection`, i.e. following the reference direction.
