# *
# * This DF is an alternative representation of the cause code value of a traffic event. 
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field ccAndScc: the main cause of a detected event. Each entry is of a different type and represents the sub cause code.
#
# * The semantics of the entire DF are completely defined by the choice value which represents the cause code value. 
# * The interpretation of the sub cause code value may provide additional information that is not strictly necessary to understand 
# * the cause code itself, and is therefore optional.
# *
# * @category: Traffic information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1, description amended in V2.2.1
