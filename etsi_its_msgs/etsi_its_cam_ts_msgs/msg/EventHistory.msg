# *
# * The DF shall contain a list of @ref EventPoint.  
# *
# * The eventPosition of each @ref EventPoint is defined with respect to the previous @ref EventPoint in the list. 
# * Except for the first @ref EventPoint which is defined with respect to a position outside of the context of this DF.

# * @category: GeoReference information, Traffic information
# * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use the @ref EventZone instead.
