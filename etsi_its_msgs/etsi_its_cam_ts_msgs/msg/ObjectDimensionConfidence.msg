# * This DE indicates the object dimension confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an object dimension value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
# * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 31`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 metre, and more than (n-1) x 0,1 metre,
# * - `31` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 3,0 m,
# * - `32` if the confidence value is unavailable.
