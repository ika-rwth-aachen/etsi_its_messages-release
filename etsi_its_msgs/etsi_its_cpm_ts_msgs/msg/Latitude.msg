# * This DE represents the absolute geographical latitude in a WGS84 coordinate system, providing a range of 90 degrees in north or
# * in south hemisphere.
# * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `n` (`n >= -900 000 000` and `n < 0`) x 10^-7 degree, i.e. negative values for latitudes south of the Equator,
# * - `0` is used for the latitude of the equator,
# * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 900 000 001`) x 10^-7 degree, i.e. positive values for latitudes north of the Equator,
# * - `900 000 001` when the information is unavailable.

# * @unit: 10^-7 degree
