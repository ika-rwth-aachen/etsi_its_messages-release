# * This DE indicates the reason why a cluster leader intends to break up the cluster.

# * The value shall be set to:

# * - 1 - `clusteringPurposeCompleted`           - if the cluster purpose has been completed,
# * - 2 - `leaderMovedOutOfClusterBoundingBox`   - if the leader moved out of the cluster's bounding box,
# * - 3 - `joiningAnotherCluster`                - if the cluster leader is about to join another cluster,
# * - 4 - `enteringLowRiskAreaBasedOnMaps`       - if the cluster is entering an area idenrified as low risk based on the use of maps,
# * - 5 - `receptionOfCpmContainingCluster`      - if the leader received a Collective Perception Message containing information about the same cluster.
