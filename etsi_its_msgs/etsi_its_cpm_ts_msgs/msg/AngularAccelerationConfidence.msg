# * This DE indicates the angular acceleration confidence value which represents the estimated accuracy of an angular acceleration value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
# * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
# * For correlation computation, maximum interval levels shall be assumed.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 - `degSecSquared-01` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 1 degree/second^2,
# * - 1 - `degSecSquared-02` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 2 degrees/second^2 and greater than 1 degree/second^2,
# * - 2 - `degSecSquared-05` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 5 degrees/second^2 and greater than 1 degree/second^2,
# * - 3 - `degSecSquared-10` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 10 degrees/second^2 and greater than 5 degrees/second^2,
# * - 4 - `degSecSquared-20` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 20 degrees/second^2 and greater than 10 degrees/second^2,
# * - 5 - `degSecSquared-50` - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 50 degrees/second^2 and greater than 20 degrees/second^2,
# * - 6 - `outOfRange`       - if the accuracy is out of range, i.e. greater than 50 degrees/second^2,
# * - 7 - `unavailable`      - if the accuracy information is unavailable.
