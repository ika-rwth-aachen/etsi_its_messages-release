# PathHistory::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(40)) OF PathPoint
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *
# * This DF represents a path history with a set of path points.
# * It shall contain up to `40` @ref PathPoint. 
# * 
# * The first PathPoint presents an offset delta position with regards to an external reference position.
# * Each other PathPoint presents an offset delta position and optionally an offset travel time with regards to the previous PathPoint. 
# *
# * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use @ref Path instead.
# * @category: GeoReference information, Vehicle information
# * @revision: semantics updated in V2.1.1
