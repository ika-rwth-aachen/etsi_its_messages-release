# * The DE describes whether the yaw rate is used to calculate the curvature for a curvature value.

# * The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 - `yawRateUsed`    - if the yaw rate is used,
# * - 1 - `yawRateNotUsed` - if the yaw rate is not used,
# * - 2 - `unavailable`    - if the information of curvature calculation mode is unknown.
