# * This DE indicates a traffic direction that is relevant to information indicated in a message.
# * 
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 `allTrafficDirections` - for all traffic directions, 
# * - 1 `upstreamTraffic`      - for upstream traffic, 
# * - 2 `downstreamTraffic`    - for downstream traffic, 
# * - 3 `oppositeTraffic`      - for traffic in the opposite direction. 
# *
# * The terms `upstream`, `downstream` and `oppositeTraffic` are relative to the event position.
# *
# * @note: Upstream traffic corresponds to the incoming traffic towards the event position,
# * and downstream traffic to the departing traffic away from the event position.
