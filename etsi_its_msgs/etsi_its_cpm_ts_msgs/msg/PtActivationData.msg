# * This DE is used for various tasks in the public transportation environment, especially for controlling traffic
# * signal systems to prioritize and speed up public transportation in urban area (e.g. intersection "_bottlenecks_").
# * The traffic lights may be controlled by an approaching bus or tram automatically. This permits "_In Time_" activation
# * of the green phase, will enable the individual traffic to clear a potential traffic jam in advance. Thereby the
# * approaching bus or tram may pass an intersection with activated green light without slowing down the speed due to
# * traffic congestion. Other usage of the DE is the provision of information like the public transport line number
# * or the schedule delay of a public transport vehicle.
