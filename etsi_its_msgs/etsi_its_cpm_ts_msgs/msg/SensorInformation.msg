# * This DF  represents the characteristics of a single sensor or data fusion system.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field sensorId: identifier of the sensor or data fusion system used to relate the perceived object in the Perceived Object Container to the sensor that detected it.
# * this identifier shall uniquely identify the sensor inside the CPM, but may be changed from one CPM to the next.
# *
# * @field sensorType: the type of the sensor.
# *
# * @field perceptionRegionShape: the perception region of the sensor.
# *
# * @field perceptionRegionConfidence: the homogeneous perception region confidence that can be assumed for the entire perception region shape of this sensor. 
# *
# * @field shadowingApplies: indicates if the standard shadowing approach applies to the described perception region.
