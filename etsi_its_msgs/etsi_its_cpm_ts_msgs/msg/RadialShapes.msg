# * This DF describes a list of radial shapes. 
# *
# * It shall include the following components:
#
# * @field refPointId: the identification of the reference point in case of a sensor mounted to trailer. Defaults to ITS ReferencePoint (0).
# * 
# * @field xCoordinate: the x-coordinate of the offset point.
# *
# * @field yCoordinate: the y-coordinate of the offset point.
# *
# * @field zCoordinate: the optional z-coordinate of the offset point.
# *
# * @field radialShapesList: the list of radial shape details.
# *
# * @category: Georeference information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1
