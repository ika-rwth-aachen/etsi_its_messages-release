# * This DE represents an angular acceleration value described in a local Cartesian coordinate system, per default counted positive in
# * a right-hand local coordinate system from the abscissa.
# *
#  * The value shall be set to: 
# * - `-255` if the acceleration is equal to or less than -255 degrees/s^2,
# * - `n` (`n > -255` and `n < 255`) if the acceleration is equal to or less than n x 1 degree/s^2,
#      and greater than `(n-1)` x 0,01 degree/s^2,
# * - `255` if the acceleration is greater than 254 degrees/s^2,
# * - `256` if the information is unavailable.
# *
# * @unit:  degree/s^2 (degrees per second squared)
# * @category: Kinematic information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
