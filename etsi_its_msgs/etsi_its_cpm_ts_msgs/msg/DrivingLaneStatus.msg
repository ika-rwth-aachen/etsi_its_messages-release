# DrivingLaneStatus ::= BIT STRING (SIZE (1..13))
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *
# * This DE indicates whether a driving lane is open to traffic.
# * 
# * A lane is counted from inside border of the road excluding the hard shoulder. The size of the bit string shall
# * correspond to the total number of the driving lanes in the carriageway.
# * 
# * The numbering is matched to @ref LanePosition.
# * The bit `0` is used to indicate the innermost lane, bit `1` is used to indicate the second lane from inside border.
# * 
# * If a lane is closed to traffic, the corresponding bit shall be set to `1`. Otherwise, it shall be set to `0`.
# * 
# * @note: hard shoulder status is not provided by this DE but in @ref HardShoulderStatus.
# * 
# * @category: Traffic information
# * @revision: V1.3.1
