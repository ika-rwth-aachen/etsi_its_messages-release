# PathPredicted::= SEQUENCE (SIZE(0..15,...)) OF PathPointPredicted
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *
# * This DF represents a predicted path with a set of path points.
# * It shall contain up to `15` @ref PathPoint. 
# * 
# * The first PathPoint presents an offset delta position with regards to an external reference position.
# * Each other PathPoint presents an offset delta position and optionally an offset travel time with regards to the previous PathPoint. 
# *
# * @category: GeoReference information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1 based on PathHistory
